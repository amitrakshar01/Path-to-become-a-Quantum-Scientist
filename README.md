# Path-to-become-a-Quantum-Scientist

## Reason for this repo:

I will be studying from the very basics of Quantum Computing, starting from today(27th June, 2021). Everyday I study I would be commiting the Research Papers I studied during the day and also the code(if I write any on that day) for Quantum Circuit simulation. If I simulate any circuit, I would even post the png form of that circuit. People interested to join with me in this study can star this repo and follow me for updates.

## What is Quantum Computing?


For the people really wondering about what exactly is Quantum Computing. Quantum Computing is a new field of Computing which relates Physics(Quantum Physics and other branches) with Computers.

## Is there future in Quantum Computing?

Of course, the domain which I will be delving into deeply in the later phase of my research is specifically known as "Quantum Networks". Now what is this "Quantum Network" thing? Simplifying the term, we get to the meaning of it: Network, i.e., a new Network or a new Internet: the Quantum Internet. When a network is being set up, it has to be secure. The  comes into play: "Quantum Cryptography", a way more secure network than the standard Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption methids being used today.

## Why is the Quantum Cryptography more secure?


Quantum Communication over the Quantum channels or Networks would take place using photons(particles of light), and these photons can't retain their state or information even if they are very very slightly disturbed. So, if a hacker tries to get into the information being carried by the photons, the polarization or the state of the photons will be disturbed and the information lost. So, practically an "Unhackable System". These Networks would be extensively used in Military and Banking Systems.

## Cons to the establishment of Quantum Networks

1. Wireless communication over long distances, keeping in-tact the entanglement of the photons is a challenge. [Micius](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/micius-a-quantum-enabled-satellite) achieved it to an extent. Give it a read by clicking on the Micius word in the previous sentence.
2. To transfer photons, we need long Optical fibers(lossless), very costly.
3. Replacing the Classical Internet with the Quantum Internet may take decades.





Afraid that you didn't understand many things. I am not a scientist too and didn't understand a lot of topics in this Quantum Computing domain, nobody understands Quantum fully.
I am going to update this repository if possible everyday about what I studied and understood and how deep I went into knowing about building an Open Source Quantum Ecosystem.
